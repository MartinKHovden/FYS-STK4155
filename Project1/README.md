# FYS-STK4155 PROJECT 1: Regression methods
Using various regression methods (OLS, Ridge, Lasso) for modelling the Franke function and
terrain data from a region in Oslo. The methods are compared and various features of
each method is studied. It shows that OLS performs best on the tests done in this project.

All the code and plots are found in the folder "src/". The main methods can be found in project1_lib.py. In addition, python files that solves each part of the project description are named after which part it solves.
 
Plots are named by data set, method used, and some info. FF: Franke function. LS: Least squares, TD: Terrain data, RR/Ridge:Ridge Regression. noise_i_j : noise = i.j. (noise_0_1: noise = 0.1).
