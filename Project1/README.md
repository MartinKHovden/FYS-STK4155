# FYS-STK4155 PROJECT 1: Regression methods
Using various regression methods (OLS, Ridge, Lasso) for modelling the Franke function and
terrain data from a region in Oslo. The methods are compared and various features of
each method is studied. It shows that OLS performs best on the tests done in this project. 

 All the code and plots are found in the folder "Data".
 Plots are named by data set, method used, and some info. FF: Franke function. LS: Least squares, TD: Terrain data, RR/Ridge:Ridge Regression. noise_i_j : noise = i.j. (noise_0_1: noise = 0.1).


 The python files are named after which part of the project it answers. Description of what is done in each file is given at the top of the file.

 The pictures does not have a title. This is because I will use captions in the pdf file. However, the filename summarizes the important information, as described over.
