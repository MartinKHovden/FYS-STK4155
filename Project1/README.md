# FYS-STK4155 PROJECT 1: Regression methods
 First project in FYS-STK4155.
 All the code and plots are found in the folder "Data".
 Plots are named by data set, method used, and some info. FF: Franke function. LS: Least squares, TD: Terrain data, RR/Ridge:Ridge Regression. noise_i_j : noise = i.j. (noise_0_1: noise = 0.1).


 The python files are named after which part of the project it answers. Description of what is done in each file is given at the top of the file.

 The pictures does not have a title. This is because I will use captions in the pdf file. However, the filename summarizes the important information, as described over.
